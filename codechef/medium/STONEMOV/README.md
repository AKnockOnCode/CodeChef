## Problem

### Stone Moving

There are $N$ piles of stones, the $i$-th pile containing $A_i$ stones.

Consider the process as follows:

- For $i = 1, 2, \ldots, N$ (in this order): Let $X = \min(A_i, N - i)$ Move $1$ stone from the pile numbered $i$ to each of the piles numbered $i + 1, i + 2, i + 3, \ldots, i + X$.

Find the total number of stones moved by the process above.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the total number of stones moved.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:

2 0 3 0 1 4
2
0 0

```

```

0
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The process happens as follows:

- $i = 1$ : $X = 2$, and we move $1$ stone from pile $1$ to each of $2$ and $3$. The resulting array $A$ is $[1, 4, 4]$.
- $i = 2$ : $X = 1$, and the array updates to $[1, 3, 5]$.
- $i = 3$ : $X = 0$, no further stone moves.

The total number of stones moved is $3$.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while (T--) {
        int N;
        scanf("%d", &N);
        long long arr[N];
        long long diff[N + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            diff[i] = 0;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            scanf("%lld", &arr[i]);
        }
        long long count = 0;
        long long received = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            received += diff[i];
            long long current = arr[i] + received;
            long long max_allowed = N - i - 1;
            long long X = current < max_allowed ? current : max_allowed;
            count += X;
            if (X > 0) {
                diff[i + 1] += 1;
                diff[i + 1 + X] -= 1;
            }
        }
        printf("%lld\n", count);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
