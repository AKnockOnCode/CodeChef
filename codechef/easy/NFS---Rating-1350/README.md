## Problem

### Turn It

Chef is playing Need For Speed. Currently, his car is running on a straight road with a velocity $U$ metres per second and approaching a $90^{\circ}$ turn which is $S$ metres away from him. To successfully cross the turn, velocity of the car when entering the turn must not exceed $V$ metres per second.

The brakes of Chef's car allow him to slow down with a deceleration (negative acceleration) not exceeding $A$ metres per squared second. Tell him whether he can cross the turn successfully. The velocity $v$ when entering the turn can be determined from Newton's 2nd law to be $v^2 = U^2 + 2 \cdot a \cdot S$ if the car is moving with a uniform acceleration $a$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $U$, $V$, $A$ and $S$.
### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"Yes"` if Chef can cross the turn successfully or `"No"` if he cannot (without quotes).

You may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq U, V, A, S \leq 10^4$
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (100 points):**  original constraints

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1
2 2 1 1
```

```
Yes
No
Yes
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  Since $U = V = 1$, Chef does not need to brake and will be able to turn successfully.

 **Example case 2:**  The smallest velocity Chef's car can have even with the maximum deceleration is $\sqrt{2 \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{2}$, which is greater than the maximum allowed velocity for a safe turn.

 **Example case 3:**  The smallest velocity Chef's car can have with the maximum deceleration is again $\sqrt{2}$, which is smaller than the maximum allowed velocity for a safe turn.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while (T--) {
    int U, V, A, S;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &U, &V, &A, &S);
    int min = U * U - 2 * A * S;
    if (V*V>=min){
        printf("Yes\n");
    }
    else{
        printf("No\n");
    }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
